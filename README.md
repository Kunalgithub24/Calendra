Just finished a full-stack Calendly-style scheduling app using Next.js 15, Clerk, Tailwind CSS, and server actions.

What I built:
• Create & manage event types
• User availability + scheduling
• Authentication with Clerk
• Full-stack logic with Server Actions
• Clean UI with Tailwind + ShadCN
• Deployed on Vercel
